#+TITLE: eBPF Qdisc classifier example

This example demonstrates how to write a simple eBPF Qdisc classifier that
classifies flows depending on their TCP port. The example comes with two
scripts, run-u32.sh and run-bpf.sh. Both scripts implement the same
functionality to make it easy to compare them. The scripts both create two
network namespaces called Left and Right, representing two different hosts, as
seen in Figure 1.

The Left namespace loads a Qdisc classifier that rate limits depending on the
destination TCP port. It also starts iperf3 clients that connect to the Right
namespace's iperf3 servers to demonstrate the rate-limiting. The Qdisc
classifiers give TCP ports 8080 and 8081 a high rate limit, while TCP port 8082
represents all other traffic capped at 20 Mbps.
